# ðŸ§  Cohort Analysis â€” Customer Retention Insights
This project performs cohort analysis using SQL to measure how well a business retains customers over time.

## ðŸ“Š Key Features
- **Monthly retention rates per cohort** â€” Track how many customers return month over month
- **Customer loyalty insights** â€” Uncover patterns in customer behavior and engagement
- **Data-driven strategies** â€” Use insights to improve customer retention and engagement

- **Each row represents a cohort** based on the month when users first joined (from February 2021 to February 2022).
- **Columns (PCT_0 to PCT_6)** indicate stages or time periods after a user's initial activity (e.g., months since first use).
- **Cell values show the percentage** of users from each cohort reaching each stage, enabling retention analysis across different time points.
- **Color intensity**: Darker shades represent higher retention percentages, making it visually easy to spot strong or weak periods.
- **All cohorts start with 100% at PCT_0**, as every cohort begins with all its users.
- **Comparing rows** reveals how user retention changes over time for each cohort; a decline across columns shows user drop-off.
- **Comparing columns across rows** reveals whether user behavior is consistent across different signup months, and highlights if certain cohorts outperform others.
- **Trend insights**: Later cohort months in 2021 show more significant drop-off in the later stages compared to earlier cohorts, suggesting declining retention or engagement over time.
- **Actionable insight**: Identifying such trends can help direct business strategies towards improving long-term retention and understanding where users are churning most.

## ðŸ“ˆ Business Impact
Cohort analysis allows businesses to:
- **Identify drop-off points** â€” Discover where and why customers stop engaging
- **Optimize marketing campaigns** â€” Target retention efforts more effectively
- **Improve revenue forecasting** â€” Better understand repeat purchase behavior

## ðŸ’¼ Example Use Case
"If 100 customers joined in January and 85 made a repeat purchase in February, the retention for month 1 is 85%. Tracking this over time helps understand customer loyalty."

## ðŸŽ¯ What we'll Learn
- How to segment customers by cohorts (signup month/period)
- How marketing, product experience, and engagement influence long-term retention
- How to translate retention data into actionable business strategies
