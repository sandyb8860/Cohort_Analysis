### Cohort Retention Heatmap

![Cohort Retention Heatmap](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd0f44ff-c593-4b78-b7c3-b743aa7fe261)

- Each row represents a cohort based on the month when users first joined (from February 2021 to February 2022)
- Columns (PCT_0 to PCT_6) indicate stages or time periods after a user's initial activity (e.g., months since first use)
- Cell values show the percentage of users from each cohort reaching each stage, enabling retention analysis across different time points
- Color intensity: Darker shades represent higher retention percentages, making it visually easy to spot strong or weak periods
- All cohorts start with 100% at PCT_0, as every cohort begins with all its users
- Comparing rows reveals how user retention changes over time for each cohort; a decline across columns shows user drop-off
- Comparing columns across rows reveals whether user behavior is consistent across different signup months, and highlights if certain cohorts outperform others
- Trend insights: Later cohort months in 2021 show more significant drop-off in the later stages compared to earlier cohorts, suggesting declining retention or engagement over time
- Actionable insight: Identifying such trends can help direct business strategies towards improving long-term retention and understanding where users are churning most

### Cohort Retention Charts

#### Cohort Retention Line Chart Insights

- All cohorts experience a significant drop in retention from Stage 0 (100%) to Stage 1, but the magnitude varies
- Retention patterns differ: some cohorts show stability after the initial drop, others continue declining or fluctuate in later stages
- Earlier cohorts (e.g., 2021-02 to 2021-04) tend to have lower overall retention than some later cohorts (e.g., 2021-09, 2021-11)
- Recent cohorts have only short lines in the chart since less data is available for later stages
- There is no single long-term retention patternâ€”each cohort behaves uniquely over time
- Analyzing cohort curves helps identify high-performing and low-performing groups, allowing for targeted retention strategies'

#### Average Retention Bar Chart Insights

- Stage 0 (Initial) retention is 100% for all cohorts
- Retention drops sharply to around 30% by Stage 1â€”this is the biggest loss point
- Average retention fluctuates between 16%â€“33% in later stages, with a general downward trend
- The lowest retention is seen at the final stage (Stage 6), at about 16%
- Improving early stage engagement can have the greatest impact on overall retention

## ðŸ“ˆ Business Impact

Cohort analysis allows businesses to:

- **Identify drop-off points** â€” Discover where and why customers stop engaging
- **Optimize marketing campaigns** â€” Target retention efforts more effectively
- **Improve revenue forecasting** â€” Better understand repeat purchase behavior

## ðŸ’¼ Example Use Case

"If 100 customers joined in January and 85 made a repeat purchase in February, the retention for month 1 is 85%. Tracking this over time helps understand customer loyalty."

- How to segment customers by cohorts (signup month/period)
- How marketing, product experience, and engagement influence long-term retention
- How to translate retention data into actionable business strategies
