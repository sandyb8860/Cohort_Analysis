This project performs cohort analysis using SQL to measure how well a business retains customers over time.

## ðŸ“Š Key Features
- **Monthly retention rates per cohort** â€” Track how many customers return month over month
- **Customer loyalty insights** â€” Uncover patterns in customer behavior and engagement
- **Data-driven strategies** â€” Use insights to improve customer retention and engagement

## ðŸ“Š Visuals and Insights

![Cohort Analysis Heatmap](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b22aace0-bd5e-4fb7-a86b-5876560e23d1)

*This heatmap visualizes the percentage values across different stages (PCT_0 to PCT_6) for each cohort month from February 2021 to February 2022. The color intensity represents the magnitude of the percentages, with darker shades indicating higher values. By examining the heatmap, we can analyze the trends within each cohort as they progress through the stages and compare the performance of different cohorts at similar stages. Later cohorts in 2021 show a decline in percentages at later stages compared to earlier cohorts.*

## ðŸ“ˆ Business Impact
Cohort analysis allows businesses to:
- **Identify drop-off points** â€” Discover where and why customers stop engaging
- **Optimize marketing campaigns** â€” Target retention efforts more effectively
- **Improve revenue forecasting** â€” Better understand repeat purchase behavior

## ðŸ’¼ Example Use Case
"If 100 customers joined in January and 85 made a repeat purchase in February, the retention for month 1 is 85%. Tracking this over time helps understand customer loyalty."

## ðŸŽ¯ What we'll Learn
- How to segment customers by cohorts (signup month/period)
- How marketing, product experience, and engagement influence long-term retention
- How to translate retention data into actionable business strategies
